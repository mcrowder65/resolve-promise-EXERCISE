Alright! Welcome back!

We have an exercise for ya!

// In the promise resolution of getDogBreeds,
// send those results into the getDogNames function,
// then output the result of getDogNames in another .then

You may be tempted to look at the implementation of utilities, but please don't, it won't provide any value to you
at this point in the course.

You can access this exercise by going to the codesandbox link in the notes section below, keep in mind that since this is
all in nodejs, you don't need to worry about the browser in the sandbox.

Good luck!
