Alright! Welcome back!

We have an exercise for ya!

You need to split your code up into a couple of functions.

Write a function called getDogNames that takes the result of `utilities.getDogBreeds()` as an argument and that returns an array of strings with the names of the dog breed
Write a function called getDogBreed which takes dogNames and a breed, returns the the single breed found
In the case where the breed isn't found, just return "Not Found"

Lastly, output the breed if found, or just "Not Found"
For our purposes, use "Golden Retriever" as the breed

You may be tempted to look at the implementation of utilities, but please don't, it won't provide any value to you
at this point in the course.

Good luck!
